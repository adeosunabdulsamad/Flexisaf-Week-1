# ES6 Features Demonstration

This project demonstrates various ES6 features using a simple HTML file. The features showcased include `let` and `const` for variable declarations, arrow functions, array methods (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `forEach`), object manipulation, destructuring, and template literals.

## File Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that includes the demonstration of ES6 features.

## Features Demonstrated

1. **Scope, let, and const**:
    - `const` is used for immutable variables.
    - `let` is used for mutable variables.

2. **Arrow Functions**:
    - Demonstrates the use of arrow functions for concise function expressions.

3. **Array Methods**:
    - `map`: Creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element.
    - `filter`: Creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.
    - `reduce`: Executes a reducer function on each element of the array, resulting in a single output value.
    - `forEach`: Executes a provided function once for each array element.

4. **Object Manipulation**:
    - Adding new properties to an object.
    - Using destructuring to extract properties from an object.

5. **Template Literals**:
    - Using template literals for string interpolation.

## How to Run

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. The browser will display the results of the ES6 features demonstration.

## Example Output

The output will include:
- The title of the demonstration.
- The initial counter value and its incremented value.
- The squares of an array of numbers.
- The even numbers from the array.
- The sum of the array.
- The doubled numbers from the array.
- User details extracted using destructuring and displayed using template literals.
